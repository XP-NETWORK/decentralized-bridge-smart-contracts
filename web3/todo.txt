make variables of values that I am checking in if conditions to reuse them and for readability


claim(): 
    has storage, no duplicate




=======================================/ DONE /=========================
IMPORTANT: save a unique hash on claim so that it cannot be reused again
update the verify signature

add check to ensure that the destination chain is the same as required


lock args
      address fromChainUserAddress, X -> not needed
      
      srcChain
      

      add: encryption type  => ECDSA
                            => EdDSA (Ed25519) | Ton & Elrond

separate storage mappings for duplicate and original

make toUser dynamic in claim() instead of msg.sender
lock emit
    token Id
    collectionAddress (srcContractAddress)
    toChainUserAddress
    metadata

    srcChain

    optional amountOfTokens


chain (args):
    srcChain
    srcContractAddress
claim 
    emit
        claim will consider it self as destination

        destinationChain
        srcChain
